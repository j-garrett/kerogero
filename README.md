  Intent:
  
Trying to build a good looking webcomic site that displays well on all screen/browser/monitor sizes.



  Small steps/goals:
  
Practicing Twitter Bootstrap 

Current art style mimics printed comic form so attempting to do same for site.

Trying to put as many things in css as possible 
    (can buttons be made with friends drawings for images? Is that a bad practice?)

Would like to figure out auto-pagination of some sort to make upkeep simpler.

(possible to turn into wordpress them later?)

What are best steps and methods for completion/practice? 
  Is being finicky about page style a distraction from taking further steps in CSS, theme, etc.?
